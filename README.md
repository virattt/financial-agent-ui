## Welcome 👋

This is a generative UI financial agent chat application.

We use Vercel's AI [SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) and
LangChain [agents](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/) to dynamically answer and render UI.

In addition, we use Polygon's [Stocks API](https://polygon.io/docs/stocks) to get real-time stock data and financials.
